In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to estimate the association between early child protection system removal and high-risk subsequent birth trajectories among a cohort of mothers with substance-exposed births in California. Of 6,893 births in 2015 with documented prenatal drug and alcohol exposure, 20.4% of mothers experienced child protection system removal within 30 days after birth. First-month child protection system removal was associated with short-interval birth (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.61, 95% CI, 1.09-2.36) and short-interval birth with documentation of substance exposure (adjusted HR 3.17, 95% CI, 1.65-6.08). We found that child separation was associated with an increase, not a reduction, in subsequent substance-exposed births.
