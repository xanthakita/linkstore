From 2018 to 2023, we analyse 176,683 onion domains and find that one-fifth share CSAM. We find that CSAM is easily available using 21 out of the 26 most-used Tor search engines. We analyse 110,133,715 search sessions from the Ahmia.fi search engine and discover that 11.1% seek CSAM. When searching CSAM by age, 40.5% search for 11-year-olds and younger; 11.0% for 12-year-olds; 8.2% for 13-year-olds; 11.6% for 14-year-olds; 10.9% for 15-year-olds; and 12.7% for 16-year-olds. We demonstrate accurate filtering for search engines, introduce intervention, show a questionnaire for CSAM users, and analyse 11,470 responses. 65.3% of CSAM users first saw the material when they were children themselves, and half of the respondents first saw the material accidentally, demonstrating the availability of CSAM. 48.1% want to stop using CSAM.

Size and Weight  The BLP-PRO-13X16 is 13\u201d x 16\u201d x 13\u201d (L,W,H) and weighs in at 7.6 lbs. without TetherTubes and 9.2 lbs. with the included four TetherTubes. The BlackPak Pro also comes in two other sizes, 13\u201dx13\u201d and a 16\u201dx16\u201d.  Construction and Assembly  Injection-molded from UV stabilized polymers, the BlackPak Pro will last for many years, even in harsh marine environments. The ultra-stiff panels utilize a rib structure that offers exceptional rigidity with minimal weight, while their interlocking joints ensure an intuitive, frustration-free assembly process. Int",
